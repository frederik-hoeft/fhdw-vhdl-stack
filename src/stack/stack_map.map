Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:864 - The following Virtex Blockram(s) is/are being retargeted to
   Virtex2 Blockram(s). This will waste 75% of Virtex2 Blockram capacity. To
   obtain better utilization, Please re-run memory generator to retarget to
   Virtex2 Blockram modules:
   RAMB4_S8 symbol "RAMB4_S8_inst" (output signal=dout_7_OBUF)

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            85 out of   9,312    1%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               107 out of   9,312    1%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:             82 out of   4,656    1%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:      82 out of      82 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of      82   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         117 out of   9,312    1%
    Number used as logic:               107
    Number used as a route-thru:         10

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 23 out of      66   34%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of      20    5%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.68

Peak Memory Usage:  671 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  6 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   6 secs
